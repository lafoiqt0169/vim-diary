INTRODUCTION                                    *diary*

This script creates a diary window in vim.  It does not rely on any
external program, such as cal, etc.

COMMANDS                                        *diary-commands*

diary.vim makes the following commands available:

:Diary [[year] month]  Show diary at this year and this month in a
                          vertical split.  When [year] is omitted, the

                          year.  When both [year] and [month] are omitted, the
                          diary will show the current month.

'goto_today'                Executes |diary_today|.            't'
'show_help'                 Displays a short help message.      '?'
